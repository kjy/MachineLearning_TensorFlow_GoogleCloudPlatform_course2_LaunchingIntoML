# MachineLearning_TensorFlow_GoogleCloudPlatform_course2_LaunchingIntoML
Creating Repeatable Splits in BigQuery.  Explored the impact of different ways of creating machine learning datasets.  Explored dataset, created ML datasets, and created a benchmark.   Exploring and Creating Datasets.  Used a taxicab dataset to train and deploy a high-accuracy distributed model with Cloud ML Engine.  Explored a dataset using BigQuery and Datalab.  Sampled the dataset and created training, validation, and testing datasets for local development of TensorFlow models.  Created a benchmark to evaluate the performance of ML.
